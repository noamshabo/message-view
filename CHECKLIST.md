### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: "Cannot find module 'next/server'"**
- Solution: Run `npm install`

**Issue: "Missing NocoDB configuration"**
- Solution: Verify `.env.local` exists and has all 4 variables

**Issue: "NocoDB API error: 401"**
- Solution: Check `NC_TOKEN` is correct

**Issue: "NocoDB API error: 404"**
- Solution: Verify `NC_PROJECT_SLUG` and `NC_TABLE_SLUG`

**Issue: No conversations showing**
- Solution: Check table has data and column names match exactly

**Issue: Port 3000 already in use**
- Solution: Stop other process or use `PORT=3001 npm run dev`
